Wearables are very popular, and are currently one of the best ways to get useful information at a glance.
CoffeeCompass is an application that leverages both the foursquare API and the integrated GPS on Garmin wearables to
find the nearest Coffee shop near you.  The application uses complex algorithms to update distance to the coffee shop live
on your wrist so you can see the distance change as you get closer or farther.  It is very helpful to see this information to
get a quick glance to see if there is a coffee shop nearby.  There are plans to introduce other categories such as 
resturants, pizza, and activities in the future.
